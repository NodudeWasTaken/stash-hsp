# stash-hsp

This is a typescript project that provides the Heresphere API for Stash app.

The easiest way to run it is to visit the docker-compose file, copy it to "docker-compose.yml", setup the stash ip, and simply run it from docker.

The docker image is available from github, so you dont need to clone this directory.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
